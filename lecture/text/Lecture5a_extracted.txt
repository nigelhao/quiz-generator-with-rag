 Human-assisted Computation: Crowdsourcing

One of the first SaaS on Amazon Cloud

For the first time in human history, hundreds of millions of people can, via the Internet, easily collaborate on the same problem.
 Human-In-Loop: Mechanical Turk
- The Turk, also known as the Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player, was a fake chess-playing machine constructed in the late 18th century. From 1770 until its destruction by fire in 1854 it was exhibited by various owners as an automaton, though it was eventually revealed to be an elaborate hoax.
- Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen to impress the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the knight's tour, a puzzle that requires the player to move a knight to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly once. Even Napoleon (Emperor of France) played against it in 1809.

The diagram shows the chess-playing automaton, with a turbaned figure seated at a table, operating the chess pieces with one hand while the other hand rests on a cushion. The automaton is surrounded by a group of onlookers, who are observing the game with interest.
 Human-In-Loop: Mechanical Turk

Once you’re inside, move the seat as far forward as you’re able.

The first thing the audience sees is the clockworks inside the left chamber.

The back set of clockworks are fake. They swing up as you slide backwards.

Wait until you hear me shut the left rear door, then go ahead.

While those are being shown, the director is entirely inside the right chamber.

Go ahead.

But the wall—

You’re now completely hidden from view.

The interior of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead anyone who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs, similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time one could see through the machine.

The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead, it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden.

These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public. In this way, he could maintain the illusion.

The second half of the divider now hides your head while the left front door is open.

And because the left rear door is closed—
 Human-In-Loop: Amazon Mechanical Turk

- In 2005, Amazon.com launched the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The service was inspired, in part, by the way Kempelen's Mechanical Turk operated.
- MTurk provides companies with access to a marketplace of on-demand workers whenever a business needs them connecting to a variety of skill sets and capabilities via a global workforce.
- Organizations can harness the power of crowdsourcing via MTurk for a range of use cases, such as microwork, human insights, and machine learning development.

What is reCAPTCHA?

reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your website from spam and abuse. It uses advanced risk analysis techniques to tell humans and bots apart.

How does it work?

reCAPTCHA presents a challenge to users that humans can easily solve, but that are difficult for bots to solve. The challenge usually involves identifying objects in a series of images.

If a user can correctly identify the objects, they are likely to be human. If they cannot, they are likely to be a bot.

reCAPTCHA also uses other factors to assess the risk of a user being a bot, such as the user's IP address and browser history.

What are the benefits of using reCAPTCHA?

reCAPTCHA can help to protect your website from a variety of threats, including:

* Spam: reCAPTCHA can help to block spam bots from submitting forms on your website.
* Abuse: reCAPTCHA can help to protect your website from abusive users, such as those who are trying to hack your site or steal your data.
* Fraud: reCAPTCHA can help to protect your website from fraud, such as credit card fraud and identity theft.

How do I add reCAPTCHA to my website?

You can add reCAPTCHA to your website by following these steps:

1. Sign up for a reCAPTCHA account.
2. Add the reCAPTCHA code to your website.
3. Customize the reCAPTCHA settings.

Once you have added reCAPTCHA to your website, it will start to protect your site from spam and abuse.

What are the different types of reCAPTCHA?

There are two types of reCAPTCHA:

* reCAPTCHA v2: This is the most common type of reCAPTCHA. It presents users with a challenge that involves identifying objects in a series of images.
* reCAPTCHA v3: This is a newer type of reCAPTCHA that is designed to be more user-friendly. It does not require users to solve a challenge, but it still provides effective protection against spam and abuse.

Which type of reCAPTCHA should I use?

The type of reCAPTCHA that you should use depends on your specific needs. If you are concerned about spam and abuse, you should use reCAPTCHA v2. If you are looking for a more user-friendly option, you should use reCAPTCHA v3.

How can I improve the accuracy of reCAPTCHA?

There are a few things that you can do to improve the accuracy of reCAPTCHA:

* Use a strong password for your reCAPTCHA account.
* Make sure that the reCAPTCHA code is properly installed on your website.
* Customize the reCAPTCHA settings to fit your specific needs.
* Monitor the reCAPTCHA logs to identify any potential problems.

By following these tips, you can help to improve the accuracy of reCAPTCHA and protect your website from spam and abuse.

 Digitizing Books

[Image of a book being scanned]

The royal palace at Friederichsberg took fire last night. The King himself directed the operations for extinguishing the fire. The whole structure was, however, destroyed.
 The image shows a book that has been scanned. The OCR (Optical Character Recognition) has been used to convert the image of the book into text. However, the OCR has not been able to read some of the words in the book. These words are marked as "between".

The second image shows a randomly distorted image of the word "between". This image has been created by the reCAPTCHA system. reCAPTCHA is a system that is used to prevent spam and abuse on websites. The system presents a distorted image of a word to the user and asks the user to type the word in the image. If the user is able to type the word correctly, the system will allow the user to access the website.

The third image shows a CAPTCHA image. The image contains the word "between" that is distorted. The user is asked to type the word in the image in the box below the image.

 The internet threatened to speed up the death of endangered languages. Could it save them instead?
By James Griffiths, CNN Business
Updated 2200 GMT (0600 HKT) October 4, 2019
Pittsburgh (CNN Business) - Noah Higgs hated learning Irish in school. He hated the way it was taught, overly formal and disconnected from ordinary people's lives. Most of all he hated the effect the lessons had on his fellow students' willingness to speak the language.
But the Dublin native never lost his love for Irish, nor his opinion that more people should be learning the language.
Today, almost 40% of the 7,000 languages spoken worldwide are endangered, according to the United Nations. More are going extinct every year.
It was once widely feared that the internet revolution would speed up this decline. If developers and smartphone manufacturers aren't willing to invest in supporting minority languages, that would cut off people who speak them from an important way to communicate and trap those languages in the past.
Higgs, 23, though, is one of a small cohort of educators and activists reinventing how minority languages are taught and preserved online by using cutting-edge technology.
When he was 17, Higgs "had this kind of crazy teenage idea." He had begun using Duolingo, a mobile language-learning app, to study French, and wondered if the creators had considered adding support for Irish.
Saving endangered languages:
Users of its smartphone or web app are presented with short, five minute lessons in which they identify words, translate short sentences, or practice speaking and listening. Users earn points for passing lessons, and they can compete in daily and weekly leaderboards. New languages can be created at https://incubator.duolingo.com

 Human-assisted Computation: Autograding

The Story of Autograding in Nemo Bot

Use crowdsourcing or human-assisted computation to extract knowledge from a large number of people to make predictions through an educational chatbot software interface (e.g., the Facebook Messenger chatbot platform) via the built-in image annotation feature to automate grading in large classes.

"Human-assisted Computation for Auto-Grading", Ling and Tan, IEEE ICDM Workshop on Machine Learning for Education 2018
 Human-assisted Computation: Autograding

Grading is hard and time-consuming, especially for large classes and MOOCs. Autograding is a way to use human computation to help with the grading process. In autograding, humans are used to grade a small sample of the assignments, and then a machine learning model is trained on the human-graded assignments. This model can then be used to grade the remaining assignments.

Autograding can be a valuable tool for educators, as it can save them time and effort. However, it is important to note that autograding is not perfect. The model can make mistakes, and it is important for educators to review the autograded assignments to ensure that they are accurate.

Despite its limitations, autograding can be a helpful tool for educators. It can save them time and effort, and it can help to improve the accuracy of grading.
 Human-assisted Computation: Autograding

The diagram shows the architecture of a human-assisted computation system for autograding. The system has three main components: a web backend, a chatbot interface, and a student response monitoring and statistics component. The web backend handles the communication between the students and the system. The chatbot interface allows the students to interact with the system and to submit their responses. The student response monitoring and statistics component monitors the students' responses and provides feedback to the instructors.

The system works as follows:

1. The instructors create quizzes and learning content using the web backend.
2. The students access the quizzes and learning content using the chatbot interface.
3. The students submit their responses to the quizzes using the chatbot interface.
4. The system monitors the students' responses and provides feedback to the instructors.
5. The instructors review the students' responses and provide feedback to the students.

Hi Chee, here's a new puzzle for you!
#cs3334 #BubbleSort
The C++ code is the bubble sort algorithm with a logic error, please find out which line(s) is not correct.
A: 4
B: 5
C: 3,5
D: 4,6

Please select the correct answer by clicking one of the buttons below
A
B
C
D
 Human-assisted Computation: Autograding

For a given MCQ with m possible choices, each choice has a prior probability of being true. Assuming we are limited to MCQs with only one correct answer each, the prior probability is 1/m. For the choice A, the correct answer is represented by Ao, where

Ao = {1 if the choice A is true
      -1 otherwise.

Note that we assume the system knows nothing about the value of Ao yet, and its job is to calculate the possibility of A being true (P(Ao = 1)) from student answers. Let the prior probability of A being true be po, i.e.

po = P(Ao = 1) = 1/m
 Human-assisted Computation: Autograding

Let a student's answer be A₁ with a probability of p₁ for their answer being correct. i.e.
p₁ = P(A₁ = 1 | Ao = 1) = P(A₁ = −1 | Ao = −1).

From Bayes' Theorem, we have
P(Ao = 1 | A₁ = 1) = 
P(A₁ = 1 | Ao = 1)P(Ao = 1)
P(A₁ = 1)

We can further rewrite it using p0 and p₁:
P(Ao = 1 | A₁ = 1) = 
p₁p0
p₁p0 + (1 − p1)(1 – p0)

P(Ao = 1|A1 = a₁) = logit-1(logit(po)+a₁logit(p1))

where the logit function is defined as logit(·) = log(1−),
and logit-1(·) = 1/exp.

The image shows a code snippet written in C programming language. The code snippet calculates the Fibonacci number. There are a few errors deliberately added in the code. The errors are:

1. In line 2, the condition `n<=1` should be `n<1`.
2. In line 5, the function call should be `fib(n-1)` instead of `fib(n)`.

The correct code should be:
```
int fib(int n) {
  if (n < 1)
    return n;
  else
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n - 1);
}
```

The Story of Kasparov Against The World

A 1999 Game of Chess over the Internet:

- Gary Kasparov (world chess champion) versus the Rest of The World (whose moves are decided by a majority vote)
- Kasparov was heavy favorite before game began.
- "Rest of The World" used on-line discussions, and inputs by five well-known chess experts, including a group called "The Computer Chess Team"
- Many weak players got hints from their home computers, which were notoriously poor at endgames.

Result: Kasparov won after 62 moves in four months.

Kasparov said it was the hardest game he ever played. This is one of the greatest moments in the AI Story and Human history.
