In this photo, we can see a large number of server racks. The racks are filled with servers, which are used to store and process data. The servers are connected to each other by cables, and they are also connected to the internet. The racks are arranged in rows, and there is a raised floor under the racks. The raised floor allows for better airflow and cooling. There is also a fire suppression system in place to help prevent fires.
 Server: Inside

The image shows a person holding a server. The server is a large, black box with a lot of wires and lights on the inside. The person is wearing a blue shirt and jeans. He is standing in a large room with a lot of other servers.
 Server cage

A server cage is a secure, dedicated space within a data center that houses servers and other IT equipment. It is typically made of metal mesh or other sturdy material and is designed to protect the equipment from unauthorized access, physical damage, and environmental hazards.

Server cages are often used by businesses that need to keep their IT equipment in a secure and reliable location. They can also be used by individuals who need to store large amounts of data or who need to run high-powered computing applications.

The diagram shows a server cage in a data center. The server cage is made of metal mesh and has a door that can be locked. Inside the server cage, there are several racks of servers. The servers are connected to each other and to the outside world by a network of cables.

Server cages are an important part of data centers. They provide a secure and reliable environment for businesses and individuals to store their IT equipment.
 ## Network room

The image shows a network room. There are many servers and network devices in the room. The servers are arranged in rows, and the network devices are mounted on racks. The room is air-conditioned to keep the equipment cool. There is also a raised floor, which allows for better airflow and cable management.

 Cooling functionality

The image shows a data center. The data center is equipped with a cooling system that uses water to cool the servers. The water is pumped through pipes that are located in the ceiling of the data center. The water absorbs the heat from the servers and then returns to the cooling tower, where it is cooled down and then pumped back into the data center.

The cooling system is designed to maintain a constant temperature in the data center. This is important because high temperatures can damage the servers. The cooling system also helps to reduce the humidity in the data center. This is important because high humidity can also damage the servers.

 So what is a cloud?

At its most basic, cloud computing is a way to access computing resources over the internet. Those resources could be anything from applications to storage to processing power.

This diagram shows the different components of a cloud computing system.

The cloud edge is the layer that connects the cloud to the end user. This includes devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

The cloud core is the layer that provides the actual computing resources. This includes things like servers, storage, and networking.

The cloud platform is the layer that manages the cloud core and provides services to the end user. This includes things like operating systems, databases, and development tools.

The cloud services layer is the layer that provides applications to the end user. This includes things like email, web hosting, and CRM software.
 A definition

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

Four types of cloud computing: private clouds, public clouds, hybrid clouds, and multiclouds

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Department of Commerce
 On-demand self-service

Suppose you open a start-up and need 20 servers for the business; cloud computing enables on-demand service.

The engineer sends an API request to the cloud. The cloud then sends back a result, which is a VM.

 On-demand self-service

A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as servers and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

Cloud computing makes the underlying technology, beyond the user device, almost invisible and transparent to users

Advantages for consumers: flexible, minimal overhead, quick and easy
 Broad network access

            The diagram shows a cloud-based network with a variety of devices connected to it. The devices include desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, and a printer. The cloud is labeled "Broad network access." The arrows between the devices and the cloud indicate that the devices can access the cloud. The cloud is connected to a server, which is labeled "Broadband access." The server is connected to the Internet, which is labeled "Global Internet."

            The diagram illustrates how a variety of devices can access the Internet through a broadband connection. The devices can access the Internet to share data, access information, and communicate with each other.
 Broad network access

Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., smart phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

Advantages for consumers: "Always-on" experience, like utilities (electricity)

Allows big amount of data to be collected from cloud edge

Cloud computing enables scalable machine learning techniques to power Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications
 ## **Resource pooling**
From the provider's perspective

A data center is a facility that houses a large number of servers. These servers are used to store and process data for a variety of businesses and organizations. In order to make the most efficient use of these servers, they are often pooled together into a single resource pool. This allows businesses and organizations to share the cost of maintaining the servers and to access the resources they need on demand.

There are a number of benefits to resource pooling. First, it can help to improve the efficiency of the data center. By sharing the resources of the servers, businesses and organizations can avoid having to purchase and maintain their own servers. This can save them money and free up space in their data centers.

Second, resource pooling can help to improve the reliability of the data center. If one server fails, the other servers in the pool can be used to take over its workload. This helps to ensure that businesses and organizations can continue to access their data and applications, even if there is a hardware failure.

Third, resource pooling can help to improve the security of the data center. By sharing the resources of the servers, businesses and organizations can make it more difficult for attackers to target their data. This is because attackers would have to compromise multiple servers in order to access the data they are looking for.

Overall, resource pooling can be a valuable tool for businesses and organizations that need to store and process large amounts of data. It can help to improve the efficiency, reliability, and security of their data centers.
 Resource pooling

The provider's resources are pooled to serve consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically allocated according to consumer demand.

Location independence: the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).

Advantage for providers: efficiency in utilization
 Cloud rapid elasticity

Resources can be rapidly and elastically scaled up and down. Suppose your business grows and needs 40 servers now. Elastic provisioning outperforms static provisioning

The diagram shows the comparison between static capacity with cloud elasticity. The x-axis is time in days, and the y-axis is resources. The blue line represents static provisioning, and the green line represents elastic provisioning.

Static provisioning is when you provision resources based on your peak load. This means that you have enough resources to handle your maximum possible traffic. However, this can be inefficient because you are paying for resources that you are not always using.

Elastic provisioning is when you provision resources based on your current needs. This means that you can scale up or down your resources as needed. This can be more efficient because you are only paying for the resources that you are using.
 Cloud rapid elasticity

With cloud computing

30 instances at
$0.055/hr = $36/day
0 idle instances at
$0.05/hr = $/day
outages=0
Active
Idle

Advantage for consumers: flexible, quick and easy

The diagram shows the scaling of cloud elasticity. The x-axis is time, and the y-axis is load. The yellow line represents the active instances, and the green line represents the idle instances. The graph shows that the number of active instances increases as the load increases. The number of idle instances decreases as the load increases. This shows that cloud elasticity can be used to scale the number of instances to meet the demand.
 Cloud economics

A cloud automatically controls and optimizes resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service.

Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer.

Cloud economics to match supply and demand. How to optimize cloud resources to match computing and storage demands?

Cloud economics: Who determines price and pricing strategies?

Pay-as-you-go, pay only for what you use.
 **Social cloud computing**

Generalize cloud computing to include the sharing, bartering, and renting of computing resources across peers whose owners and operators are verified through a social network or reputation system.

Basis of emerging Web 3.0 applications past the confines of formal commercial data centers operated by cloud providers to include anyone interested in participating within the cloud services sharing economy.

 Cloud Summary

Cloud computing is an umbrella term used to refer to Internet-based development and services.

A number of characteristics define cloud data, applications, services, and infrastructure:

Remotely hosted: Services or data are hosted on remote infrastructure.
Ubiquitous: Services or data are available from anywhere.
Commodified: The result is a utility computing model similar to traditional that of traditional utilities, like gas and electricity - you pay for what you would want!

 IaaS

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

Providers give you the computing infrastructure made available as a service. You get "bare-metal" machines.

Providers manage a large pool of resources (i.e., servers), and use virtualization to dynamically allocate servers

Customers "rent" these physical resources to customize their own infrastructure

You operate the Operating System (OS) and all the software on the servers by yourself
 IaaS
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
Virtualization and Virtual Machines

This diagram illustrates the difference between traditional and virtualized environments. In a traditional environment, each physical server runs a single operating system and application. This can be inefficient, as it often leads to underutilized servers. In a virtualized environment, a single physical server can run multiple virtual machines, each with its own operating system and application. This allows for more efficient use of resources and can help to improve scalability and agility.

In a traditional environment, each physical server is dedicated to a single application or service. This can be inefficient, as it often leads to underutilized servers. For example, a web server may only be used during peak hours, while a database server may only be used during business hours. This means that both servers are idle for a significant portion of the day.

In a virtualized environment, a single physical server can run multiple virtual machines, each with its own operating system and application. This allows for more efficient use of resources, as each virtual machine can be sized to meet the specific needs of the application it is running. For example, a web server can be allocated more resources during peak hours, while a database server can be allocated more resources during business hours. This allows both servers to be used more efficiently, which can save money.

Virtualization can also help to improve scalability and agility. In a traditional environment, adding new servers can be a time-consuming and expensive process. In a virtualized environment, new virtual machines can be provisioned quickly and easily. This allows businesses to scale their IT infrastructure quickly and easily to meet changing needs.

Virtualization is a powerful technology that can help businesses to improve efficiency, scalability, and agility. By virtualizing their IT infrastructure, businesses can save money, improve performance, and respond more quickly to changing needs.
 IaaS Applications
Netflix rents thousands of servers, terabytes of storage from Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Develop and deploy specialized software for transcoding, storage, streaming, analytics, etc. on top of service delivery
Able to support tens of millions of connected devices used by 40+ million users from 40+ countries
 Virtualization

Virtual workspaces:
- An abstraction of an execution environment that can be made dynamically available to authorized clients by using well-defined protocols,
- Resource quota (e.g. CPU, memory share),
- Software configuration (e.g. O/S, provided services).

Implement on Virtual Machines (VMs):
- Abstraction of a physical host machine,
- Hypervisor intercepts and emulates instructions from VMs. and allows management of VMs,
- VMWare, Xen, etc.

Provide infrastructure API:
- Plug-ins to hardware/support structures

Diagram:
The diagram shows the components of a virtualized stack. The bottom layer is the hardware, which is virtualized by the hypervisor. The hypervisor provides an API to the guest operating systems, which are then able to run applications. The applications are isolated from each other by the hypervisor.
 Virtual Machines

VM technology allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine.

The diagram shows how multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own operating system and applications. The virtual machines are isolated from each other, so they cannot interfere with each other. The physical machine's hardware is shared between the virtual machines.

There are several different ways to create virtual machines. One way is to use a virtualization software program, such as VMware or VirtualBox. Another way is to use a hardware virtualization feature that is built into the physical machine's CPU.

Virtual machines can be used for a variety of purposes. They can be used to test new operating systems or applications, to run multiple operating systems on a single machine, or to provide a secure environment for running untrusted applications.

Performance: Para-virtualization (e.g., Xen) is very close to raw physical performance!
 PaaS

Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

Providers give users with a software platform or middleware where applications run

You develop and maintain and deploy your own software on top of the platform

The hardware needed to run the software is automatically managed by the platform. There are limitations on explicit management of resources.

Examples: SQL as a service (SQLaaS), Matlab, Gurobi
 PaaS

You have automated scalability without the need to respond to request load increase or decrease

Ideal for deployment of mobile apps, web apps, etc.

Application programming interface (API) support via popular languages like Python, Javascript, Java, PHP, and Go

Java Runtime
Web 2.0 Runtime
Data analytics Engine
 SaaS

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

Providers give you a piece of software/application, and take care of updating, maintaining and troubleshooting the application.

As end user, you simply use the software using the Internet.

Business model of SaaS: business-to-business (B2B), business-to-clients (B2C) that cover numerous retail end users
 Nowadays, many institutions use Google Apps, Apple cloud, and Office 365 for emails, video meetings, calendars, etc.

Business uses SaaS for payment and transactions. The legal industry relies on SaaS for compliance, while the creative industry relies on SaaS for artwork (e.g., computer-generated images). Engineers rely on SaaS to design circuits/software. Students rely on SaaS to learn and collaborate.

What are the scientific applications of SaaS?
 SaaS Maturity Model

Level 1: Ad-Hoc/Custom – One Instance per customer

Level 2: Configurable per customer

Level 3: configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient

Level 4: Scalable, Configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient

The diagram shows the four levels of SaaS maturity.

Level 1 is Ad-Hoc/Custom. In this level, each customer has their own dedicated instance of the software. This is the least efficient level of SaaS maturity, as it requires the most resources to maintain.

Level 2 is Configurable per customer. In this level, customers can configure their own instances of the software. This is more efficient than Level 1, as it allows customers to tailor the software to their specific needs.

Level 3 is configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient. In this level, multiple customers share a single instance of the software. This is more efficient than Level 2, as it reduces the number of resources required to maintain the software.

Level 4 is Scalable, Configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient. In this level, the software is able to scale to meet the needs of multiple customers. This is the most efficient level of SaaS maturity, as it provides the best balance of cost and performance.
 **Comparison of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS**

The diagram shows the relationship between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). IaaS is the most basic level of cloud computing, and it provides users with access to virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking. PaaS is a more advanced level of cloud computing, and it provides users with a platform on which to develop and deploy their applications. SaaS is the most advanced level of cloud computing, and it provides users with access to software applications that are hosted in the cloud.

The diagram also shows the trade-off between flexibility and built-in functionality. IaaS provides users with the most flexibility, but it also requires users to have the most technical expertise. PaaS provides users with less flexibility, but it also requires less technical expertise. SaaS provides users with the least flexibility, but it also requires the least technical expertise.

The choice of which cloud computing model to use depends on the specific needs of the user. If the user needs the most flexibility, then IaaS is the best option. If the user needs a platform on which to develop and deploy their applications, then PaaS is the best option. If the user needs access to software applications that are hosted in the cloud, then SaaS is the best option.
 Opportunities and Challenges

The use of the cloud provides a number of opportunities:

IaaS enables services to be used without any understanding of their infrastructure.

Cloud computing works using economies of scale:
- IaaS and PaaS potentially lower the outlay expense for start up companies, as they would no longer need to buy their own software or servers.
- Cost would be by on-demand pricing in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.
- Cloud providers claim costs by establishing an ongoing revenue stream.

Data and services are stored remotely but accessible from "anywhere" in SaaS.
 Opportunities and Challenges

In parallel there has been backlash against cloud computing: Use of cloud computing means dependence on others and that could possibly limit flexibility and innovation: The others are likely become the bigger Internet companies like Google and IBM, who may monopolise the market. Some argue that this use of supercomputers is a return to the time of mainframe computing that the PC was a reaction against. Security could prove to be a big issue: It is still unclear how safe out-sourced data to SaaS is and when using these services ownership of data in SaaS is not always clear. There are also issues relating to policy and access: If your data is stored abroad whose policy do you adhere to? What happens if the remote server goes down? How will you then access files? There have been cases of users being locked out of accounts and losing access to data.
 # Advantages of Cloud Computing

IaaS leads to lower computer costs:
- You do not need a high-powered and high-priced computer to run cloud computing's web-based applications.
- Since applications run in the cloud, not on the desktop PC, your desktop PC does not need the processing power or hard disk space demanded by traditional desktop software.
- When you are using web-based applications, your PC can be less expensive, with a smaller hard disk, less memory, more efficient processor...
- In fact, your PC in this scenario does not even need a CD or DVD drive, as no software programs have to be loaded and no document files need to be saved.
 Advantages of Cloud Computing

IaaS leads to unlimited storage capacity:
Cloud computing offers virtually limitless storage. Your computer’s current 1 Tbyte hard drive is small compared to the hundreds of Pbytes available in the cloud.

IaaS leads to increased data reliability:
Unlike desktop computing, in which if a hard disk crashes and destroys all your valuable data, a computer crashing in the cloud should not affect the storage of your data. If your personal computer crashes, all your data is still out there in the cloud, still accessible.

In a world where few individual desktop PC users back up their data on a regular basis, cloud computing is a data-safe computing platform!
 Advantages of Cloud Computing

PaaS leads to improved performance:
With few large programs hogging your computer's memory, you will see better performance from your PC.
Computers in a cloud computing system boot and run faster because they have fewer programs and processes loaded into memory.

SaaS leads to reduced software costs:
Instead of purchasing expensive software applications, you can get most of what you need for free-ish!
- most cloud computing applications today, such as the Google Docs suite. Better than paying for similar commercial software which alone may be justification for switching to cloud applications.
 Advantages of Cloud Computing

PaaS and SaaS take care of instant software updates:
Another advantage to cloud computing is that you are no longer faced with
choosing between obsolete software and high upgrade costs.
With web-based applications (i.e., SaaS), updates happen automatically
- available the next time you log into the cloud.
When you access a web-based application, you get the latest version
without needing to pay for or download an upgrade.

SaaS leads to improved document format compatibility.
You do not have to worry about the documents you create on your
machine being compatible with other users' applications or OSes
There are potentially no format incompatibilities when everyone is sharing
documents and applications in the cloud.
 # Advantages of Cloud Computing

SaaS leads to universal document access:
That is not a problem with cloud computing because you do not take your documents with you. Instead, they stay in the cloud, and you can access them whenever you have a computer and an Internet connection. Documents are instantly available from wherever you are.

SaaS leads to the latest version availability:
When you edit a document at home, that edited version is what you see when you access the document at work. The cloud always hosts the latest version of your documents - as long as you are connected, you are not in danger of having an outdated version.
 Advantages of Cloud Computing

SaaS leads to easier group collaboration:

Sharing documents leads directly to better collaboration. Many users do this as it is an important advantage of cloud computing.
- Multiple users can collaborate easily on documents and projects.

Device independence:

You are no longer tethered to a single computer or network. Changes to computers, applications, and documents follow you through the cloud. Move to a portable device, and your applications and documents are still available.
 Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

Requires a constant Internet connection:

Cloud computing is impossible if you cannot connect to the Internet. Since you use the Internet to connect to both your applications and documents, if you do not have an Internet connection you cannot access anything, even your own documents. A dead Internet connection means no work and in areas where Internet connections are few or inherently unreliable, this could be a deal-breaker.
 Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

Does not work well with low-speed connections:
Similarly, a low-speed Internet connection, such as that found with dial-up services, makes cloud computing painful at best and often impossible. Web-based applications require a lot of bandwidth to download, as do large documents.

Features might be limited:
This situation is bound to change, but today many web-based applications simply are not as full-featured as their desktop-based applications.
- For example, you can do a lot more with Microsoft PowerPoint than with Google Presentation's web-based offering
 Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

Can be slow:
Even with a fast connection, web-based applications can sometimes be slower than accessing a similar software program on your desktop PC.
Everything about the program, from the interface to the current document, has to be sent back and forth from your computer to the computers in the cloud.
If the cloud servers happen to be backed up at that moment, or if the Internet is having a slow day, you would not get the instantaneous access you might expect from desktop applications.
 Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

Stored data might not be secure:
With cloud computing, all your data is stored on the cloud.
The question is How secure is the cloud?
Can unauthorized users gain access to your confidential data?

Stored data can be lost:
Theoretically, data stored in the cloud is safe, replicated across multiple machines.
But on the off chance that your data goes missing, you have no physical or local backup.
Put simply, relying on the cloud puts you at risk if the cloud lets you down.
 Disadvantages of Cloud Computing

HPC Systems:
Not clear that you can run compute-intensive HPC applications that use MPI/OpenMP!
Scheduling is important with this type of application
- As you want all the VM to be co-located to minimize communication latency!

General Concerns:
Each cloud systems uses different protocols and different APIs
- May not be possible to run applications between cloud based systems
Amazon has created its own DB system (not SQL), and workflow system (many popular workflow systems out there)- so your normal applications will have to be adapted to execute on these platforms.
