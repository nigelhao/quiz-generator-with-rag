Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

What is virtualization?
Virtualization is a broad term. It can be applied to all types of resources (CPU, memory, network, etc.)
Allows one computer to “look like” multiple computers, doing multiple jobs, by sharing the resources of a single machine across multiple environments.
History
Believe it or not:
- Virtualization started in the 1960s in IBM's mainframe
The image shows a woman standing next to an IBM mainframe computer. The computer is large and takes up most of the room. The woman is wearing a lab coat and is looking at the computer.
A 'non-virtualized' system has a single OS that controls all hardware platform resources.
A virtualized system makes it possible to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical platform.
In the diagram, the non-virtualized system has a single operating system that is responsible for managing all of the hardware resources, such as the processor, memory, and storage. The virtualized system, on the other hand, has a virtualization layer that allows multiple operating systems to run on the same physical hardware. Each operating system runs in its own virtual machine, which is isolated from the other virtual machines. This allows for greater flexibility and security, as each operating system can be configured and managed independently.

The old model
A server for every application
Software and hardware are tightly coupled
The diagram shows the old model of computing, where each application has its own dedicated server. This model is tightly coupled, meaning that the software and hardware are closely integrated and cannot be easily separated. This makes it difficult to scale and maintain the system, as changes to the software or hardware require changes to the other.
Big disadvantage: low utilization

The new model
* Physical resources are virtualized. OS and applications as a single unit by encapsulating them into virtual machines
* Separate applications and hardware
The diagram shows the new model for virtualization. Physical resources are virtualized, and the operating system and applications are encapsulated into virtual machines. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as well as improved security.
Big advantage: improved utilization

Some terms
The diagram shows the relationship between applications, the operating system, the virtualization layer, and the hardware architecture.
The applications are at the top level and interact with the operating system. The operating system provides a layer of abstraction between the applications and the hardware. The virtualization layer allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine. The hardware architecture is the foundation of the system and provides the basic instructions that the operating system and applications need to run.
The x86 architecture is a family of instruction sets that are used in most personal computers. The CPU is the central processing unit and is responsible for executing instructions. The memory is used to store data and instructions that are being processed by the CPU. The NIC is the network interface controller and is responsible for connecting the computer to a network. The disk is used to store data that is not currently being processed by the CPU.

Hosted architecture
A hosted architecture installs and runs the virtualization layer as an application on top of an operating system
Hosted architecture
* Indirect access to hardware through the host OS
* Performance penalty, usually for desktops and personal use

Hypervisor architecture
The hypervisor architecture installs the virtualization layer, called hypervisor, directly on a clean x86-based system.
Installer is usually an ISO installing a tailor-made OS.
The diagram shows the hypervisor architecture. The hypervisor is a software layer that runs on top of the hardware and provides virtualization services to the guest operating systems. The guest operating systems are isolated from each other and from the hardware by the hypervisor. This allows multiple guest operating systems to run on the same hardware simultaneously.
- It has direct access to hardware resources
- A hypervisor is more efficient than a hosted architecture and delivers greater scalability, robustness, and performance
- For production use
