Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

Cloud & Virtualization
- Cloud computing is often associated with virtualization due to its elasticity.
- Launching new VMs in a virtualized environment is both cost-effective and rapid.
- A cloud infrastructure essentially functions as a virtual machine management infrastructure.

An IaaS Cloud
The diagram depicts an IaaS cloud comprising a controller node responsible for cloud management, along with two computing nodes tasked with running virtual machines (VMs). These VMs are stored on a VM image storage node.
The controller node:
- Manages the cloud, tracking VM deployments across computing nodes.
- Ensures VMs are adequately resourced.
- Handles user requests for VM creation, management, and termination.
The computing nodes:
- Provide CPU, memory, and storage resources for VM operations.
- Execute commands from the controller node regarding VM management.

The VM image storage node:
- Stores VM images used for creating new VM instances.
- Responds to controller node requests related to VM image management.
Subtleties
A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a network linking storage devices to servers, typically via a fabric channel.
iSCSI, a block-level storage protocol, facilitates data transfer over TCP/IP networks. It operates by transferring data in fixed-size blocks and is commonly employed to connect servers to storage devices within a SAN.
In the diagram:
- Each of the two computing nodes is connected to two VMs.
- The computing nodes link to the SAN via iSCSI, which constitutes a fabric-based network connecting storage devices to servers.
