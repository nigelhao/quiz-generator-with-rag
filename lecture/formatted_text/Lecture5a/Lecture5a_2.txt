Lecture 5a: Crowdsourcing in Cloud

**The Story of Autograding in Nemo Bot**
Utilizing crowdsourcing or human-assisted computation to extract knowledge from a large number of individuals to make predictions through an educational chatbot software interface, such as the Facebook Messenger chatbot platform, via the built-in image annotation feature to automate grading in large classes.
*"Human-assisted Computation for Auto-Grading"*, Ling and Tan, IEEE ICDM Workshop on Machine Learning for Education 2018
Grading is challenging and time-consuming, particularly for large classes and MOOCs. Autograding employs human computation to assist with the grading process. In autograding, humans grade a small sample of assignments, and then a machine learning model is trained on these assignments to grade the remaining ones.
Autograding is a valuable tool for educators, saving them time and effort. However, it's essential to acknowledge its imperfections. The model can make errors, necessitating educators to review autograded assignments for accuracy.
Despite its limitations, autograding can significantly aid educators, streamlining their workload and enhancing grading accuracy.
The system architecture for human-assisted computation in autograding consists of three main components: a web backend, a chatbot interface, and a student response monitoring and statistics component.
The web backend facilitates communication between students and the system, receiving quizzes and learning content from students and sending responses to the chatbot interface.
The chatbot interface provides students with feedback on their quizzes and learning content using natural language processing to understand questions and provide helpful responses.
The student response monitoring and statistics component monitors student progress and provides instructors with performance statistics, aiding in identifying struggling students who require additional assistance.

**The Story of Kasparov Against The World**
A 1999 Game of Chess over the Internet:
- Gary Kasparov (world chess champion) versus the Rest of The World (moves decided by majority vote)
- Kasparov was heavily favored before the game began.
- "Rest of The World" utilized online discussions and inputs from five well-known chess experts, including "The Computer Chess Team."
- Many weak players received hints from their home computers, notoriously poor at endgames.
Result: Kasparov won after 62 moves in four months.
Kasparov described it as the hardest game he ever played, marking one of the greatest moments in AI and human history.
