Lecture 2: Data Center Networkingâ€“ Basics, Topology

Some basic concepts
Diagrams are a great way to visualize information. They can help you to see the relationships between different parts of a system and to identify patterns and trends. There are many different types of diagrams, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common types include:
Flowcharts: Flowcharts are used to represent the flow of information or data through a system. They can be used to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in a process.
Block diagrams: Block diagrams are used to represent the components of a system and the relationships between them. They can be used to identify the major components of a system and how they interact with each other.
Organizational charts: Organizational charts are used to represent the hierarchy of an organization. They can be used to identify the different levels of management and the reporting relationships between them.
Venn diagrams: Venn diagrams are used to represent the relationships between different sets of data. They can be used to identify the similarities and differences between different sets of data.
Pie charts: Pie charts are used to represent the proportions of different parts of a whole. They can be used to identify the relative sizes of different parts of a whole.
Bar charts: Bar charts are used to represent the values of different variables. They can be used to compare the values of different variables and to identify trends.
Line charts: Line charts are used to represent the changes in a variable over time. They can be used to identify trends and to make predictions about the future.

Building blocks
- Nodes: end-hosts, or hosts (PC, server), switches, routers, middleboxes
- Links: coax cable, optical fiber, wireless, etc.
  - point-to-point
  - multiple access (shared)
Switching approaches
- Circuit switching:
  - (early) telephone networks
  - Connection oriented, dedicated communication link between two nodes
- Packet switching:
  - computer networks
  - Connection-less, shared communication links, no set-up
  - Data is divided into packets and transferred independently
Addressing, routing
- Address: byte-string that identifies a node
- Routing: process of forwarding messages to the destination node based on its address
- Types of addresses:
  - unicast: node-specific
  - broadcast: all nodes on the network
  - multicast: a group/subset of nodes
