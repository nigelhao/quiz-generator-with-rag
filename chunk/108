Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

PageRank example
The PageRank of a web page is a measure of its importance or popularity. It is calculated by taking into account the number and quality of links to the page. The PageRank of a page is determined by the following formula:
PR(a) = (1-d) + d * (PR(b)/C(b) + PR(c)/C(c) + PR(d)/C(d))
where:
PR(a) is the PageRank of page a
d is a damping factor that is typically set to 0.85
C(b) is the number of outgoing links from page b
PR(b) is the PageRank of page b
