Lecture 4: Cloud CPU Scheduling

Motivation
When multiple VMs send instructions to the host, which instructions should the host CPU execute first?

Resource contention
On a host with 1GHz CPU, how to emulate a 400MHz CPU?
CPU scheduling is important in delivering performance guarantees and resource isolation.
