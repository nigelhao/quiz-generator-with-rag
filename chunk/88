## Eventual Consistency
### A Facebook Example
- Bob tells Alice to wait a bit and check out later
- Alice waits for a minute or so and checks back:
- She finds the story Bob shared with her!
The diagram shows a Facebook wall. On the left, Bob is posting a story. On the right, Alice is checking her feed. The arrow between them indicates that Bob's story will eventually be visible to Alice.
* **Reason**: It is possible because Facebook uses an eventual consistent model
* **Why Facebook chooses eventual consistent model over the strong consistent one?**
    * Facebook has more than 1 billion active users
    * It is non-trivial to efficiently and reliably store the huge amount of data generated at any given time
    * Eventual consistent model offers the option to reduce the load and improve availability
### A Dropbox Example
* Dropbox enabled immediate consistency via synchronization in many cases.
* However, what happens in case of a network partition?
* Let's do a simple experiment here:
    * Open a file in your dropbox
    * Disable your network connection (e.g., WiFi, 4G)
    * Try to edit the file in the dropbox: can you do that?
    * Re-enable your network connection: what happens to your dropbox folder?
- Dropbox embraces eventual consistency:
    - Immediate consistency is impossible in case of a network partition
    - Users will feel bad if their word documents freeze each time they hit Ctrl+S, simply due to the large latency to update all devices across WAN
    - Dropbox is oriented to personal syncing, not on collaboration, so it is not a real limitation.
### An ATM Example
- In design of automated teller machine (ATM):
 - Strong consistency appear to be a nature choice
 - However, in practice, A beats C
 - Higher availability means higher revenue
 - ATM will allow you to withdraw money even if the machine is partitioned from the network
 - However, it puts a limit on the amount of withdraw (e.g., $200)
 - The bank might also charge you a fee when a overdraft happens
The diagram shows an ATM machine. The user is able to withdraw money from the ATM even if the machine is partitioned from the network. However, there is a limit on the amount of money that can be withdrawn. The bank might also charge a fee if the user overdrafts their account.
