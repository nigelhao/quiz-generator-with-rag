Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

Modified Version of PageRank
\[ R'(u) = c_1 âˆ‘ \frac{R'(v)}{N_v} + c_2E(u) \]
\[ v \in B_u \]
\[ E(u) \]: a distribution of ranks of web pages that "users" jump to when they "get bored" after successive links at random.

An example of Modified PageRank
The diagram shows a modified PageRank algorithm.
- There are three web pages: Yahoo, Amazon, and Microsoft.
- The weight of the link from Yahoo to Amazon is 1/2, the weight of the link from Amazon to Microsoft is 1/2, and the weight of the link from Microsoft to Yahoo is 1/2.
- The initial rank of each page is 1/3.
- The modified PageRank of Yahoo is 0.333, the modified PageRank of Amazon is 0.333, and the modified PageRank of Microsoft is 0.333.
