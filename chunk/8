What are the scientific applications of SaaS?
SaaS Maturity Model
Level 1: Ad-Hoc/Custom â€“ One Instance per customer
Level 2: Configurable per customer
Level3: configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient
Level 4: Scalable, Configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient
The diagram shows the four levels of SaaS maturity.
Level 1 is Ad-Hoc/Custom. In this level, each customer has their own dedicated instance of the software. This is the least efficient level of SaaS maturity, as it requires the most resources to maintain.
Level 2 is Configurable per customer. In this level, customers can configure their own instances of the software. This is more efficient than Level 1, as it allows customers to tailor the software to their specific needs.
Level 3 is configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient. In this level, multiple customers share a single instance of the software. This is more efficient than Level 2, as it reduces the number of resources required to maintain the software.
Level 4 is Scalable, Configurable & Multi-Tenant-Efficient. In this level, the software is able to scale to meet the needs of multiple customers. This is the most efficient level of SaaS maturity, as it provides the best balance of cost and performance.
