Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

PageRank vs. Web Traffic
- An important component of PageRank calculation is E.
  - A vector over the web pages (used as a source of rank).
  - A powerful parameter to adjust the page ranks.
- The vector E corresponds to the distribution of web pages that a random surfer periodically jumps to from the search engine.
- Some highly accessed web pages have low page rank, possibly because:
  - People do not want to link to these pages from their own web pages (the example in the 1998 PageRank paper is pornographic sites...).
  - Some important backlinks are omitted.
- Use web usage data as a start vector for PageRank.
