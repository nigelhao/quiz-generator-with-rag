Lecture 4: Cloud CPU Scheduling

Credit scheduler
Weight: default value is 256. Range: [1,65535]
Cap: optionally fix the CPU this VM can get, even if the CPU has idle cycles (NWC)
default is 0, WC
set to percentages. For example 30, meaning this VM can get 30% of the CPU at most.

Credit scheduler - basics
Time unit/slot: 30ms
A VM has priority, which can be one of two values: "over" or "under" representing whether this VM has or hasn't yet exceeded its fair share of CPU resource in the ongoing accounting period.
Each CPU manages a FIFO queue of runnable VMs sorted by priority (under precedes over).
At each slot, the VM off the head of the queue gets to run

Credit scheduler - accounting
As a VM runs, it consumes credits. Every 30ms, a system-wide accounting thread recomputes the credits for each active VM.
Every so often, the system bumps credit to each VM. The credit is allocated in a PS fashion (weighted fair sharing).
