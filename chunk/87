Lecture 6: CAP Theorem

Types of Consistency
* Strong Consistency
After the update completes, any subsequent access will return the same updated value.
* Weak Consistency
It is not guaranteed that subsequent accesses will return the updated value.
* Eventual Consistency
Specific form of weak consistency
It is guaranteed that if no new updates are made to object, eventually all accesses will return the last updated value (e.g., propagate updates to replicas in a lazy fashion)
 ## Eventual Consistency
- A Facebook Example
* Bob finds an interesting story and shares with Alice by posting on her Facebook wall
* Bob asks Alice to check it out
* Alice logs in her account, checks her Facebook wall but finds:
 - Nothing is there!
