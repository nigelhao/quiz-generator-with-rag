Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

Virtual Machine Advantages:
- Move whole images anywhere: completely decouple all software from hardware.
- Can replicate computer images: run more copies.
- If your service is overloaded, scale out by spinning up more instances.
- Can arbitrarily start/stop/resume instances very quickly.
- Must faster than shutting down machines.
- Complete software encapsulation.
- Common technique used in software tutorials: download this VM image and run it.
- Web hosting: one server can run 100 virtual machines, each one thinks it has a complete, independent computer to configure and use.
- Complete software isolation.
- In theory, two VMs are completely isolated, can maybe only sense something due to timing (e.g., if they are sharing a CPU), more on this later.
- Enabled us to have cloud computing.
- Original business case was the desktop! E.g., need to run Windows and Linux in parallel, don't want 2 machines.
