Lecture 2: Data Center Networking– Basics, Topology

A layering architecture
The diagram shows a layering architecture. The architecture is divided into three layers: the presentation layer, the business logic layer, and the data access layer.
The presentation layer is responsible for interacting with the user. It handles the user interface and the presentation of data to the user.
The business logic layer is responsible for handling the logic of the application. It contains the business rules and the logic for processing data.
The data access layer is responsible for accessing the data. It handles the interaction with the database and the retrieval and storage of data.

Layering
How to build an internet that connects all different kinds of networks, each of which may use a completely different technology?
Answer: layering, with well-defined interfaces
Best summarized by David Clark, MIT, “The Design Philosophy of the DARPA Internet Protocols"

Why layering?
- Functions are separated into layers. Layers are "blackboxes" to the upper- or lower-layer protocols.
- Allow distinct technologies for the same function.
  - physical: Ethernet, 3G, WiFi, satellite, optical, quantum, etc.
- Allow them to inter-operate using standardized interfaces
