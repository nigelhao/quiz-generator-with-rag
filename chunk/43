Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

Cloud & Virtualization
- Cloud computing is often associated with virtualization due to its elasticity.
- Launching new VMs in a virtualized environment is both cost-effective and rapid.
- A cloud infrastructure essentially functions as a virtual machine management infrastructure.

An IaaS Cloud
The diagram depicts an IaaS cloud comprising a controller node responsible for cloud management, along with two computing nodes tasked with running virtual machines (VMs). These VMs are stored on a VM image storage node.
The controller node:
- Manages the cloud, tracking VM deployments across computing nodes.
- Ensures VMs are adequately resourced.
- Handles user requests for VM creation, management, and termination.
The computing nodes:
- Provide CPU, memory, and storage resources for VM operations.
- Execute commands from the controller node regarding VM management.
