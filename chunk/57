Lecture 4: Cloud CPU Scheduling

Simple earliest deadline first (SEDF)
SEDF. EDF is a widely used scheduling algorithm in OS.
Each VM specifies its CPU requirement with a tuple (s_i, p_i, x_i)
VM i wants to receive at least s_i units of time in each period of length p_i.
x_i: whether to receive extra CPU time (work conserving)
For each VM, the scheduler keeps two variables:
d_i: time at which VM i's current period ends, i.e. deadline
r_i: remaining CPU time in the current period
At each time slot, among the VMs whose r_i is positive, schedule the one with the earliest deadline to run. Ties are broken arbitrarily.

SEDF example
When x_i=0, non work conserving, the VM is made runnable periodically, i.e. r_i is reset to s_i at the start of each period.
Example: VM 1: (1,2,0), VM 2: (2,7,0)
The image shows a diagram with two horizontal lines representing the VMs. VM1 has a period of 1 and a deadline of 2. VM2 has a period of 2 and a deadline of 7. The x-axis represents time. The diagram shows that VM1 is runnable at time 0, 7, 14, etc. VM2 is runnable at time 0, 2, 7, 9, 14, etc.
The least common multiple of the periods is 14. So the scheduling pattern will repeat every 14 slots.
What's the CPU utilization? It suffices to look at the first 14 slots.
