Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

Third OS Concept: Process
* Process: execution environment with Restricted Rights
    * Address Space with One or More Threads
    * Owns memory (address space)
    * Owns file descriptors, file system context, â€¦
    * Encapsulate one or more threads sharing process resources
* Why processes?
    * Protected from each other!
    * OS Protected from them
    * Navigate fundamental tradeoff between protection and efficiency
    * Processes provides memory protection
* Application instance consists of one or more processes
Protection
- Operating System must protect itself from user programs
  - Reliability: compromising the operating system generally causes it to crash
  - Security: limit the scope of what processes can do
  - Privacy: limit each process to the data it is permitted to access
  - Fairness: each should be limited to its appropriate share
- It must protect User programs from one another
  - Primary Mechanism: limit the translation from program address space to physical memory space
    - Can only touch what is mapped in
  - Additional Mechanisms:
    - Privileged instructions, in/out instructions, special registers
    - syscall processing, subsystem implementation
      - (e.g., file access rights, etc)
