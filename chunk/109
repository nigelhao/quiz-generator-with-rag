# Random Walkers
- For large graphs, solving linear systems of equations is intractable.
- Random surfers: Where do you end if you follow links at random?
-
a
c
b
Start at node a: after one step, end
up in b, c, or d with probability 1/3.
d
- Transition matrix: Mij = 1 if j → i ∈ E and 0 otherwise.
dj
- The transition matrix is column-stochastic: columns sum to 1.

Random Walkers: Transition Matrix Example
A random walker is a mathematical model of a particle that moves randomly. It is often used to simulate the motion of particles in a fluid or gas.
In this example, we will consider a random walker that moves on a graph. The graph has four nodes, labeled a, b, c, and d. The edges between the nodes are labeled with probabilities. For example, the edge between a and b is labeled with the probability 1/2. This means that if the random walker is at node a, it will move to node b with probability 1/2.
The transition matrix for this random walker is a 4x4 matrix. The element in the ith row and jth column of the transition matrix is the probability that the random walker will move from node i to node j.
For example, the element in the first row and second column of the transition matrix is 1/2. This is because the probability that the random walker will move from node a to node b is 1/2.

The transition matrix for this random walker is:
```
0 1/2 1 0
1/3 0 0 1/2
1/3 0 0 1/2
1/3 1/2 0 0
```
