Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

PageRank: Random Surfer Model
The probability of the surfer being at node x after n hops can be calculated using the following steps:
1. Initialize the vector P(x, 0) to 1/N for all x in N.
2. For each n from 1 to n, update the vector P(x, n) using the formula given above.
3. Return the vector P(x, n).
The following table shows the probability of the surfer being at each node after 1, 2, and 3 hops:
| Node | P(x, 1) | P(x, 2) | P(x, 3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| a | 0.167 | 0.169 | 0.170 |
| b | 0.167 | 0.169 | 0.170 |
| c | 0.167 | 0.169 | 0.170 |
| d | 0.167 | 0.169 | 0.170 |
| e | 0.167 | 0.169 | 0.170 |
| f | 0.167 | 0.169 | 0.170 |
As you can see from the table, the probability of the surfer being at any particular node after n hops is roughly the same. This is because the damping factor d causes the surfer to randomly jump to different pages, which prevents the surfer from getting stuck at any particular node.
Imagine a surfer on the web, randomly clicking links. What is the probability that the surfer will be at a particular page after n hops? We assume that the surfer starts at a random page.
This is the PageRank model, a way of ranking web pages based on their importance. The more important a page is, the higher its PageRank.
The PageRank of a page is calculated by taking the sum of the PageRanks of the pages that link to it, divided by the number of links on those pages.
For example, in the diagram above, the PageRank of page A is calculated by taking the sum of the PageRanks of pages B, C, and D, divided by the number of links on those pages.
