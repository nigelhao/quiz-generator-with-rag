Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

Hardware-assisted
The diagram illustrates two modes: root mode and non-root mode.
In root mode, there are four rings: -1, 0, 1, and 2.
In non-root mode, there are three rings: 0, 1, and 2.
The guest OS kernel operates in ring 0, while the hypervisor operates in ring -1.
Guest applications run in ring 3.
Host hardware is at the diagram's bottom, indicating virtualization by the host hardware.
Text below suggests hardware-assisted virtualization as a likely future standard for server virtualization.
