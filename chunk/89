Lecture 6: CAP Theorem

Dynamic Tradeoff between C and A
- An airline reservation system:
 - When most of seats are available: it is ok to rely on somewhat out-of-date data, availability is more critical
 - When the plane is close to be filled: it needs more accurate data to ensure the plane is not overbooked, consistency is more critical
- Neither strong consistency nor guaranteed availability, but it may significantly increase the tolerance of network disruption
 Discussion
* In a cloud computing system (e.g., Amazon, Google cloud, etc), what are the trade-offs between consistency and availability you can think of? What is your strategy?
* Hint -> Things you might want to consider:
    * Different types of data (e.g., shopping cart, billing, product, etc.)
    * Different types of operations (e.g., query, purchase, etc.)
    * Different types of services (e.g., distributed lock, DNS, etc.)
    * Different groups of users (e.g., users in different geographic areas, etc.)
