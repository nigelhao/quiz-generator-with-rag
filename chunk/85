Lecture 6: CAP Theorem

In practice, most distributed systems are either CP or AP systems. CA systems are rare because they are difficult to design and implement.
 A popular misconception: 2 out 3
- How about CA?
- Can a distributed system (with unreliable network) really be not tolerant of partitions?
The diagram shows a Venn diagram with two circles. The left circle is labeled "C" and the right circle is labeled "A". The intersection of the two circles is labeled "CA".
The question is "Can a distributed system (with unreliable network) really be not tolerant of partitions?". The answer is "yes".
A distributed system is a system that is composed of multiple computers that are connected by a network. A partition is a division of the network into two or more parts, such that the computers in one part cannot communicate with the computers in the other part.
A distributed system can be tolerant of partitions if it is designed in such a way that it can continue to operate even if one or more partitions occur. This can be done by using techniques such as replication, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
However, if a distributed system is not designed to be tolerant of partitions, then it may not be able to continue to operate if a partition occurs. This can lead to data loss, service outages, and other problems.

A few witnesses
- Coda Hale, Yammer software engineer:
- â€œOf the CAP theorem's Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, Partition Tolerance is mandatory in distributed systems. You cannot not choose it."

Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO
- "An important observation is that in larger distributed-scale systems, network partitions are a given; therefore, consistency and availability cannot be achieved at the same time."
 A few witnesses
- Daniel Abadi, Co-founder of Hadapt
- So in reality, there are only two types of systems
...
I.e., if there is a partition, does the system give up availability or consistency?
