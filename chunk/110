Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

## PageRank with random walkers
- Start random surfers at all pages with equal probability
$$V_0 = [1/n, 1/n, . . ., 1/n]$$
- After one step, the distribution will be
$$V_1 = MV_0$$
- After k steps:
$$V_k = M^kV_0$$
- Markov process: The distribution approaches a limiting distribution V such that V = MV if
 - The graph is strongly connected: can get from a node to any other node.
 - No dead ends: nodes that have no out-links.
v = Mv.
- Surfers are stationary.
- The more important a page, and the more likely it is to have a surfer.
- v is... the principal eigenvector of M. (M stochastic has largest eigenvalue 1.)
- Power iteration: compute v by iterative matrix-vector multiplications.
- Stop when ||v^t - v^(t-1)|| <= epsilon.
- How eigenvectors are computed in large dimensions (e.g. Lanczos method.)
- Amenable to MapReduce parallelization.
- Equivalent to previous PageRank formulation:
v_i = \Sigma d_ij / d_j
Example
a ⟶ b
c ⟶ d

Transition matrix:
[0 1/2 1 0]
[1/3 0 0 1/2]
[1/3 1/2 0 0]
[0 0 1 0]
- Initialization: V0 = [1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4].
- After one step: V1 = [9/24, 5/24, 5/24, 5/24].
- After two steps: V2 = [15/48, 11/48, 11/48, 11/48].
- ...
- Converges to: V = [1/3, 2/9, 2/9, 2/9].
