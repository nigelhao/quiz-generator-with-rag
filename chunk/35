Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

First OS Concept: Thread of Control
- Thread: Single unique execution context
 - Program Counter, Registers, Execution Flags, Stack
- A thread is executing on a processor when it is resident in the processor registers.
- PC register holds the address of executing instruction in the thread.
- Certain registers hold the context of the thread
 - Stack pointer holds the address of the top of stack
 - Other conventions: Frame Pointer, Heap Pointer, Data
May be defined by the instruction set architecture or by compiler conventions
- Registers hold the root state of the thread.
 - The rest is "in memory"
