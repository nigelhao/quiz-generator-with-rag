2004: four-post cluster
Supported 20k servers per cluster
The diagram shows a four-post cluster. There are four cluster routers, each of which is connected to two ToR switches. The ToR switches are then connected to the servers. Each server has two 10GbE connections to the ToR switches. But traffic keeps growing
The diagram shows the growth of traffic generated by servers in Google's datacenters. The traffic has been growing exponentially since 2008. This growth is likely due to the increasing number of people using Google's services, such as Search, Gmail, and YouTube. The growth in traffic is also likely due to the increasing use of mobile devices, which are constantly generating data.

How to scale the network
- Buying the largest switches with the most ports doesn't scale well
- And it's expensive
- Solution: Clos topologies
The diagram shows a Clos topology. A Clos topology is a hierarchical network design that is used to scale networks. The Clos topology consists of three stages: the spine stage, the aggregation stage, and the edge stage. The spine stage is the core of the network and it is responsible for connecting the aggregation switches. The aggregation stage is responsible for connecting the edge switches to the spine switches. The edge stage is responsible for connecting the servers to the aggregation switches.
A practical approach to scale
- Use Clos topologies:
  - Use many low-radix switches in multiple stages to scale to arbitrary size
  - Substantial path diversity and redundancy
- Merchant silicons
  - off-the-shelf, allows regular and rapid upgrades
