**The Story of Kasparov Against The World**
A 1999 Game of Chess over the Internet:
- Gary Kasparov (world chess champion) versus the Rest of The World (moves decided by majority vote)
- Kasparov was heavily favored before the game began.
- "Rest of The World" utilized online discussions and inputs from five well-known chess experts, including "The Computer Chess Team."
- Many weak players received hints from their home computers, notoriously poor at endgames.
Result: Kasparov won after 62 moves in four months.
Kasparov described it as the hardest game he ever played, marking one of the greatest moments in AI and human history.
