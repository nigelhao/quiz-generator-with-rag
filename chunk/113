Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

Summary
Large-scale data poses new technical problems for:
- storage → distributed file systems.
- computations → MapReduce programming model.
Split the data in chunks.
Map workers all execute the same operation on a chunk and return a key-val pair.
Reduce workers process all key-val pairs with the same key at once.

Algorithmic costs of MapReduce:
- Communication costs vs. computation costs.
- Reducer size and replication rate.
Extensions of MapReduce: Spark and TensorFlow.
MapReduce for machine learning.
Link analysis with PageRank.
