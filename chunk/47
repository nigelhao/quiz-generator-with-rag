Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks: RAID 1
- Key idea: organize data to withstand failures
- Simplest approach: mirroring (RAID 1)
- Halves capacity but remains more economical than a single large disk
- Probability of two replicas failing: 1-(1-p^2)^(n/2)
- For instance, if p = 0.001 and n = 20, the chance of RAID array failure is ≈ 0.00001% each month
The diagram demonstrates RAID 1's mirroring concept, ensuring data availability even if one disk fails.
The Power of XOR
- XOR enables better recovery data methods than simple replication
- Exclusive OR (XOR) operation
- Example: with drives A and B, an additional drive C is calculated as C = A ⊕ B
- If B fails, recovery can be done using B = A ⊕ C
A	B	C
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0
Diagram:
Blocks A and B are XORed to generate C. In case of B's failure, B can be recovered using A and C through XOR.
