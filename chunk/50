Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

Virtual Machine:
- Software that makes code (running in a process) think that it's running on raw hardware.
- A virtual machine monitor runs in the host operating system.
- It loads and runs disk images for guest operating systems.
- Operations in the guest operating system that are normally not allowed trap into the virtual machine monitor.
  - Guest operating system tries to change page tables.
  - Guest operating system tries to disable interrupts.
- Virtual machine monitor emulates the hardware.
