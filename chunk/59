Lecture 4: Cloud CPU Scheduling

SEDF - more examples
Exercise for tutorial Try to schedule the following cases.
VM 1: (2,6, 0), VM 2: (1, 3, 0), VM 3: (1,6, 0)
VM 1: (1,8,0), VM 2: (2,5, 0), VM 3: (4, 6, 10)
Optional and experimental: Try to set x_i=1 for some of the VMs...

**SEDF - summary**
Features:
- Fairness depends on the value of the period
- WC and NWC modes
Disadvantage:
- Implements per-CPU scheduling. Lacks global load balancing on multiprocessors
