Lecture 6: CAP Theorem

Consistency or Availability
Consistency and Availability is not a "binary" decision
AP systems relax consistency in favor of availability â€“ but are not inconsistent
CP systems sacrifice availability for consistency- but are not unavailable
This suggests both AP and CP systems can offer a degree of consistency, and availability, as well as partition tolerance
The diagram shows a Venn diagram with three circles. The circles are labeled "C" (for consistency), "A" (for availability), and "P" (for partition tolerance). The "X" marks the spot where all three circles overlap.
The diagram illustrates that there is a trade-off between consistency and availability. AP systems relax consistency in favor of availability, while CP systems sacrifice availability for consistency. However, both types of systems can offer a degree of partition tolerance.
 AP: Best Effort Consistency
* Example:
    * Web Caching
    * DNS
* Trait:
    * Optimistic
    * Expiration/Time-to-live
    * Conflict resolution
 CP: Best Effort Availability
* **Example:**
    * Majority protocols
    * Distributed Locking (Google Chubby Lock service)
* **Trait:**
    * Pessimistic locking
    * Make minority partition unavailable
