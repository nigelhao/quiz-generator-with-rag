Lecture 6: CAP Theorem

Summary of CAP Theorem
* In the presence of a network partition:
* In order to keep the replicas consistent, you need to block.
    - From an outside observer, the system appears to be unavailable.
* If we still serve the requests from two partitions, then the replicas will diverge.
    - The system is available, but no consistency.
* The CAP theorem explains this dilemma.
