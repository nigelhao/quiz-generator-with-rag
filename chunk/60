Lecture 4: Cloud CPU Scheduling

Credit scheduler
Xen's latest PS (proportional share) scheduler featuring automatic load balancing across physical CPUs.
Default scheduler in Xen.
Each VM is assigned a weight and a cap.
> Idea based on Stride Scheduling
Jobs have a “stride” value
- A stride value describes the counter pace when the job should give up the CPU
- Stride value is inverse in proportion to the job's number of tickets (more tickets = smaller stride)

Total system tickets = 10,000
- Job A has 100 tickets
- Job B has 50 tickets
- Job C has 250 tickets
Astride = 10000/100 = 100 stride
Bstride = 10000/50 = 200 stride
Cstride = 10000/250 = 40 stride
Stride scheduler tracks “pass” values for each job (A, B, C)
