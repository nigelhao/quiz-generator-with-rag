Lecture 5b: Cloud Security

**Two Methods**
There are two primary ways in which a plain text message can be codified to obtain a ciphertext: Substitution and Transposition.

**Substitution**
- Modified Caesar Cipher: each alphabet is replaced by one that is k places down the line, where k is from 1 to 25.
- You need 25 attempts at most to crack k and decipher the ciphertext.
- Instead of a uniform substitution scheme, you can have a random substitution.
- Polygram Substitution Cipher: replace a block of alphabets with another. “HELLO” -> “YUQQW”, “HELL” -> "TEUI"

**Transposition**
In addition to replacing the alphabets, we also perform some permutation over them.
Rail Fence Technique: Write down the plain text as a sequence of diagonals. Read the text written as above as a sequence of rows.
Plain text: "Come home tomorrow"
Cipher text: Cmhmtmrooeoeoorw
In transposition, the position of letters in the plaintext is changed to produce the ciphertext. The key is the permutation that is applied to the plaintext to produce the ciphertext.
