### RAID 0
- Stripes data across disks
- For n disks of size S, total capacity becomes nS bytes
The diagram illustrates RAID 0's data striping mechanism, enhancing data access speed. However, RAID 0 lacks redundancy, resulting in total data loss if one disk fails.
## RAID 0 Problems
- Failure of one disk leads to the failure of the entire RAID array
- Assuming each disk has a failure probability p per month
- Probability of all n disks not failing: (1-p)^n
- For example, if p = 0.001 and n = 20, there's a 2% chance of RAID array failure each month
The diagram presents a RAID 0 array with six disks, illustrating the probability calculation for array failure due to disk failure.
