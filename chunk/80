Lecture 6: CAP Theorem

## CAP Theorem
* Conjectured by Prof. Eric Brewer at PODC (Principle of Distributed Computing) 2000 keynote talk
* Described the trade-offs involved in distributed system
* It is impossible for a web service to provide following three guarantees at the same time:
    * Consistency
    * Availability
    * Partition-tolerance
The CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide all of the following three guarantees:
* Consistency: All nodes in the system have the same data at all times.
* Availability: Every request to the system is guaranteed to succeed.
* Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate correctly even if some of the nodes in the system fail.
In other words, a distributed system can only provide two out of the three guarantees. This is because there is a trade-off between consistency and availability. If a system is strongly consistent, then it may not be available all the time. Conversely, if a system is highly available, then it may not be strongly consistent.
The CAP theorem is a fundamental limitation of distributed systems. It is important to understand this theorem when designing distributed systems, as it can help you to make informed decisions about the trade-offs that you need to make.
 ## CAP Theorem
* Consistency:
 * All nodes should see the same data at the same time
* Availability:
 * Node failures do not prevent survivors from continuing to operate
* Partition-tolerance:
 * The system continues to operate despite network partitions
* A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time but not all three
