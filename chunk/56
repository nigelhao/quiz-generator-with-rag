Lecture 4: Cloud CPU Scheduling

CPU Scheduling
Implemented in the hypervisor
Fairness
- Idea: use weights
- Each VM gets a share of CPU in proportion to the weight
- Weighted max-min; Proportional fairness, Priority scheduling
Utilization
- What if a VM is just idle, while the other has lots of things to do? (suppose they have equal weights)
- Should the host CPU allocate all the available cycles to the busy VM?
* Work-conserving: The host CPU is idle if and only if there is no runnable VM. The weights act as guarantees. Utilization is good.
* Non work-conserving: Weights are caps. Each VM owns its fraction of CPU.
A Tradeoff
Tradeoff between fairness and utilization work-conserving schedulers are more efficient, but less fair non work-conserving schedulers are less efficient, but more fair
