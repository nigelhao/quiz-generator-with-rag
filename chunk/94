Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

PageRank: Random Surfer Model
= someone surfing the web, clicking links randomly
* What is the probability of being at page x after n hops?
The diagram shows a web graph with 6 nodes labeled a, b, c, d, e, and f. The nodes are connected by directed edges. The surfer starts at node e and randomly surfs the web by clicking on links. The probability of the surfer being at node x after n hops is given by the following formula:
P(x, n) = (1-d)/N + d * sum(P(y, n-1) * L(y, x)) for all y in N(x)
where:
N is the total number of nodes in the graph
d is a damping factor that controls the probability of the surfer continuing to surf the web or jumping to a random page
L(y, x) is the probability of the surfer clicking on the link from node y to node x
The damping factor d is typically set to 0.85. This means that the surfer has an 85% chance of continuing to surf the web and a 15% chance of jumping to a random page.
