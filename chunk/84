Lecture 6: CAP Theorem

Why this is important?
- The future of cloud computing is distributed (Big Data Trend, etc.)
- CAP theorem describes the trade-offs involved in distributed systems
- A proper understanding of CAP theorem is essential to making decisions about the future of distributed system design
- Misunderstanding can lead to erroneous or inappropriate design choices
 Revisit CAP Theorem
* Of the following three guarantees potentially offered by distributed systems:
    * Consistency
    * Availability
    * Partition tolerance
* Pick two
* This suggests there are three kinds of distributed systems:
    * CP
    * AP
    * CA
Any problems?
The CAP theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:
* Consistency: All nodes in the system have the same data at all times.
* Availability: All nodes in the system are always available.
* Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate correctly even if some of the nodes in the system fail.
In other words, a distributed system can only provide two of the three CAP guarantees.
The diagram shows the relationship between the three CAP guarantees. The X marks the point where all three guarantees are不可能同时满足. The three circles represent the three kinds of distributed systems that are possible:
* CP systems: These systems provide consistency and partition tolerance, but not availability.
* AP systems: These systems provide availability and partition tolerance, but not consistency.
* CA systems: These systems provide consistency and availability, but not partition tolerance.
