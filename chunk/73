Lecture 5b: Cloud Security

**Some Concepts**
- Cryptography: a mechanism of encoding messages so that they can be sent securely.
- Brute-force attack: try all combinations and permutations to decipher a message.
- Encryption: encoding the plaintext into ciphertext.
- Decryption: the reverse process.
Encryption/decryption involves two aspects: the algorithm and the key. The sender and receiver must agree on a common algorithm for encryption/decryption. The key is used to make the process of cryptography secure. The algorithm is known to everybody.
