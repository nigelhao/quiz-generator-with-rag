Lecture 3: Virtualization in Cloud

Reed-Solomon Coding
- For scenarios with higher failure probabilities (e.g., thousands of drives)
- Reed-Solomon coding converts k data blocks into n, capable of recovering from any (n-k) failures
- Example: converting 223 data blocks into 255 enables recovery from any 32 failures
- Widely used in CDs, DVDs, QR codes, Mars Rovers, and most cloud storage systems
- RAID 6 utilizes Reed-Solomon for two parity drives
The diagram depicts how Reed-Solomon coding operates, dividing data into blocks and generating parity blocks for recovery.
