Lecture 5b: Cloud Security

**Cryptography**
Broadly, there are two mechanisms used in cryptography:
1. **Symmetric Key Cryptography:** the same key is used for encryption and decryption.
2. **Asymmetric Key Cryptography:** two different keys are used.

**Symmetric Key Cryptography**
The communication channel is insecure. How can we settle on the key to be used for cryptography over this insecure channel?
