Lecture 1: Basics, IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

On-demand self-service
Suppose you open a start-up and need 20 servers for the business. Cloud computing enables on-demand service.
The engineer sends an API request to the cloud. The cloud then sends back a result, which is a VM.
A consumer can unilaterally provision com     puting capabilities, such as servers and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
Cloud computing makes the underlying technology, beyond the user device, almost invisible and transparent to users
Advantages for consumers: flexible, minimal overhead, quick and easy

Broad network access
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
Advantages for consumers: "Always-on" experience, like utilities (electricity)
Allows big amount of data to be collected from cloud edge
Cloud computing enables scalable machine learning techniques to power Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications
