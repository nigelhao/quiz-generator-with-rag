Lecture 5b: Cloud Security

**Plain Text and Cipher Text**
A cryptosystem has five important characteristics:
1. **Security:** The cryptosystem should be resistant to attack. An attacker should not be able to read the plaintext without knowing the key.
2. **Usability:** The cryptosystem should be easy to use. The encryption and decryption processes should be efficient and easy to implement.
3. **Scalability:** The cryptosystem should be able to handle large amounts of data. It should be able to encrypt and decrypt data quickly, even for large files.
4. **Reliability:** The cryptosystem should be reliable. It should not fail or lose data.
5. **Flexibility:** The cryptosystem should be flexible. It should be able to be used in a variety of applications.
In addition to these five characteristics, a cryptosystem may also have other desirable properties, such as:
- **Forward secrecy:** The cryptosystem should not be vulnerable to attacks that exploit knowledge of past keys.
- **Backward secrecy:** The cryptosystem should not be vulnerable to attacks that exploit knowledge of future keys.
- **Deniability:** The cryptosystem should allow a user to deny that they have encrypted or decrypted a message.
- **Integrity:** The cryptosystem should ensure that the plaintext is not modified during transmission.
- **Non-repudiation:** The cryptosystem should prevent a user from denying that they sent or received a message.

The choice of cryptosystem depends on the specific application. For example, a cryptosystem that is used to protect sensitive government data will need to have a high level of security. A cryptosystem that is used to protect data that is transmitted over the Internet will need to be efficient and scalable.

**Plain text:**
> Can be understood by anyone knowing the language
Hi Bob, I really like you and I know you have some problems with your new movie. Maybe you wanna talk about it with me, say this Saturday 8pm at Hotel A? Alice
**Ciphertext:**
> Use some scheme to codify the message, so that it's not easily understood by someone who doesn't know the coding scheme.
