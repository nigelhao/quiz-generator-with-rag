Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

PageRank: Random Surfer Model
Imagine a surfer on the web, randomly clicking links.
What is the probability of the surfer being at a particular web page after n hops (clicks)?
We can model this using a directed graph, where each node represents a web page and each edge represents a link between two web pages. The surfer starts at a random node and then follows a random link to another node. This process is repeated n times.
The probability of the surfer being at a particular node after n hops is given by the PageRank algorithm. PageRank is a link analysis algorithm that measures the importance of web pages. It is used by Google to rank search results.
The PageRank algorithm works by iteratively applying the following formula to each node in the graph:
```
PR(i) = (1-d) + d * (PR(j)/C(j))
```
where:
* PR(i) is the PageRank of node i
* d is a damping factor that is typically set to 0.85
* PR(j) is the PageRank of the node that links to node i
* C(j) is the number of outgoing links from node j
The damping factor d is used to prevent the PageRank algorithm from getting stuck in a loop. It also helps to ensure that all nodes in the graph have a non-zero PageRank.
The PageRank algorithm is a powerful tool for measuring the importance of web pages. It is used by Google to rank search results, and it can also be used to identify influential nodes in a social network.
