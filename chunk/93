Lecture 7: Pagerank Algorithm

PageRank
- Not just a count of inlinks
- A link from a more important page is more important
- A link from a page with fewer links is more important
- A page with lots of inlinks from important pages (which have few outlinks) is more important
 PageRank Model

The Web: a directed graph
G = (V, E)
Vertices (pages)	Edges (links)
a	(a, e), (a, f)
b	(b, d)
c	(c, b)
d	(d, a), (d, c), (d, f)
e	(e, b), (e, d), (e, f)
f	(f, a)

Which is the most “important” vertex?
V = {a, b, c, d, e, f }
E = {(a, e), (a, f), (b, d), (c, b), (d, a), (d, c), (d, f), (e, b), (e, d), (e, f), (f,a)}
